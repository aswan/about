Welcome to WebExtensions Experiments
====================================

WebExtensions are a cross-browser system for developing browser add-ons.

WebExtensions Experiments allow developers to write experimental WebExtensions APIs for Firefox. They can be used to prototype APIs for landing in Firefox, or for use on `Nightly <https://nightly.mozilla.org/>`_ or `Developer Edition <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Developer_Edition>`_.

Information about
`policies for WebExtensions APIs <https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions/policy>`_ and
`how to request a new API <https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions/NewAPIs>`_
are available on the Mozilla wiki.
